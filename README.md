# Jade DevOps Portfolio

> Infrastructure that scales. Systems that serve. Growth built in public.

## 👋🏾 About Me

Hi, I’m Jade—DevOps engineer, youth developer, and infrastructure builder.

I started my tech journey through a sponsored DevOps course with Jomacs IT, and stepped into real-world engineering before the course even ended. Since then, I’ve been building real-world infrastructure across cloud, hybrid, and Kubernetes environments. From designing observability stacks to deploying production-grade data platforms and SaaS tools, I don’t just spin up containers — I ship resilient systems that run in live environments.

No shortcuts. No templates. Just clean infra built from zero.

I was trained. I was tested. And every project here proves what I’ve built.

## 🧠 What These Projects Prove

- I can architect and deploy real services end-to-end — **not labs, not local setups**
- I manage secrets, persistence, ingress, scaling, and integrations in production conditions
- I write Terraform and Helm configs that are **modular, secure, and reusable**
- I build for **longevity, reliability, and clarity** — with documentation and purpose

---

## 💡 Current Focus

- Continuing to build a **blueprint library** for reusable infrastructure modules
- Exploring **data engineering workflows** (Airbyte → DBT → Warehouse)
- Preparing for **MLOps integration** into existing DevOps foundations

---

## 🛠️ Work Philosophy

I don’t build in labs—I build in live systems.  
My code runs in production. My dashboards catch real alerts.  
And every failure has become part of my documentation.

This portfolio is as much a **record of wins** as it is a **library of lessons**.  
Because growth isn’t something I talk about—it’s something I commit to.
