 # Jade DevOps Portfolio

> Infrastructure that scales. Systems that serve. Growth built in public.

## 👋🏾 About Me

Hi, I’m Jade—DevOps engineer, youth developer, and infrastructure builder.

I started my tech journey through a sponsored DevOps course with Jomacs IT, and stepped into real-world engineering before the course even ended. Since then, I’ve deployed and managed production-grade infrastructure across hybrid environments—cloud, on-prem, and everything in between.

I was trained. I was tested. And every project here proves what I’ve built.

## 🛠️ Work Philosophy

I don’t build in labs—I build in live systems.  
My code runs in production. My dashboards catch real alerts.  
And every failure has become part of my documentation.

This portfolio is as much a **record of wins** as it is a **library of lessons**.  
Because growth isn’t something I talk about—it’s something I commit to.
